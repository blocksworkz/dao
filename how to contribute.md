# How to contribute

Contributing to the governance of the project can be completed by being a BLKZ token owner only. The DAO is configured to allow those who have BLKZ in their wallet to take control of decisions.

## Connecting Wallet
At the time of writing MetaMask is recommended as the wallet of choice when contributing, other wallets are supported by SnapShot.org however these are not all compatible with the XDC Network.

The network settings recommended for use are below: 

 - Network Name - XDC Mainnet (RPC)
 - RPC - https://rpc.xinfin.network
 - Chain ID - 50
 - Currency Symbol - XDC
 - Block Explorer - https://explorer.xinfin.network/

## Adding BLKZ to MetaMask
The BLKZ token will need to be added to MetaMask so that when you connect to the space on SnapShot.org the balance can be checked. The steps are below:

 1. Open MetaMask
 2. Your balance will be displayed
 3. Click the Import Tokens link
 4. In the token address enter - 0x4826634fe187ed3ffb64d77c5c1a67ba49cc03de
 5. The token symbol will automatically display BLKZ and the decimals will be set to 18
 6. You will now see the BLKZ token amount under the Assets
