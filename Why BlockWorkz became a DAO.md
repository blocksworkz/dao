# Why BlocksWorkz became a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

BlocksWorkz originally started off as a private project which was managed and maintained by a small team in the UK. The team designed, built and launched two successful projects; XDCNFT.com, XDCSwaps.com and launched the $BLKZ token which is used across both products.

Since inception of BlocksWorkz the team have been engaged with the community and promoted the products across different platforms and audiences. The primary target of these activities have been towards the XDC (XinFin) network communities as this was where the $BLKZ token was minted.

The acquisition and subsequent conversion of users and sales has not aligned with the forecast volumes that the team had planned. Combined with wider economic factors which have adversely impacted the crypto markets the volume of NFT sales, volume of swaps on the DEX and performance of the $BLKZ token has made it difficult to grow adoption.

By moving BlocksWorkz to a DAO model the ownership and governance of the products, token and future activities can driven entirely by the community. This approach removes centralised decisions so the community can be responsible for the future success.
