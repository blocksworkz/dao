## BlocksWorkz DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization)

BlocksWorkz is a decentralized, community managed organisation. BlocksWorkz is a member-owned community without centralized leadership, the direction and governance of the organisation is managed by the community.

XDCNFT, XDCSWAPS and the $BLKZ token are all owned and managed by the community.

The creation of proposals and voting on these proposals can be completed via http://blocksworkz.xyz/ (Snapshot.org)

## Proposals
The creation of proposals is managed by a group of authors whom will take feedback from the community and then decide to create proposals in which can be voted on.

### Admins
Admins are responsible for the management of the DAO and SnapShot.org space that is created for the launch. The admins will be responsible for the up-keep of the space, treasury, assigning/removing authors and drive adoption of the products, features and eco-system.

The admins will also have access to the social media accounts for the BlocksWorkz products including @BlocksWorkz and @XDCNFT.

### Authors
Authors have the authority to create proposals on behalf of the community, these proposals will be created using a standard format which gives a clear outcome and decision. Ambiguous proposals with no clear outcome or decision can be void or removed by authors and admins.

## Voting
The voting process for DAOs is posted on a blockchain. Users must often select between mutually-exclusive options. Voting power is often distributed across users based on the number of tokens they hold. For example, one user that owns 100 BLKZ tokens of the DAO will have twice the weight of voting power over a user that owns 50 tokens.


## Benefits of a DAO based approach

### Decentralization
Decisions impacting the organization are made by a collection of individuals as opposed to a central authority that is often vastly outnumbered by their peers. Instead of relying on the actions of one individual (CEO) or a small collection of individuals (Board of Directors), a DAO can decentralize authority across a vastly larger range of users.

### Participation
Individuals within an entity may feel more empowered and connected to the entity when they have a direct say and voting power on all matters. These individuals may not have strong voting power, but a DAO encourages token holders to cast votes, burn tokens, or use their tokens in ways they think is best for the entity.

### Publicity
Within a DAO, votes are cast via blockchain and made publicly viewable. This requires users to act in ways they feel is best, as their vote and their decisions will be made publicly viewable. This incentivizes actions that will benefit voters' reputations and discourage acts against the community.

### Community
The concept of a DAO encourages people from all over the world to seamlessly come together to build a single vision. With just an internet connection, tokenholders can interact with other owners wherever they may live.
