## BlocksWorkz DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization)

BlocksWorkz is a decentralized, community managed organisation. BlocksWorkz is owned by the community without centralized leadership, the direction and governance of the organisation is managed by the BLKZ token holders only.

Decisions, discussions, proposals and developments are managed by the community.

XDCNFT, XDCSWAPS, SuperBullsNFT and the $BLKZ token are all owned and managed by the community.

The creation of proposals and voting on these proposals can be completed via http://blocksworkz.xyz/ (Snapshot.org).

Community discussions will take place on Telegram at the following group - https://t.me/BLKZ_BlocksWorkz

## Proposals
The creation of proposals is managed by a group of authors whom will take feedback from the community and then decide to create proposals in which can be voted on.

### Admins
Admins are responsible for the management of the DAO and SnapShot.org space that is created for the launch. The admins will be responsible for the up-keep of the space, treasury, assigning/removing authors and drive adoption of the products, features and eco-system.

The admins will also have access to the social media (Twitter, YouTube, Instgram, Telegram) accounts for the BlocksWorkz products including @BlocksWorkz @SuperBullsNFT @XDCNFT.

### Authors
Authors have the authority to create proposals on behalf of the community, these proposals will be created using a standard format which gives a clear outcome and decision. Ambiguous proposals with no clear outcome or decision can be void or removed by authors and admins.

## Voting
The voting process for DAOs is posted on a blockchain. Users must often select between mutually-exclusive options. Voting power is often distributed across users based on the number of tokens they hold. For example, one user that owns 100 BLKZ tokens of the DAO will have twice the weight of voting power over a user that owns 50 tokens.


## Benefits of a DAO based approach

### Decentralization
Decisions impacting the organization are made by a collection of individuals as opposed to a central authority that is often vastly outnumbered by their peers. Instead of relying on the actions of one individual (CEO) or a small collection of individuals (Board of Directors), a DAO can decentralize authority across a vastly larger range of users.

### Participation
Individuals within an entity may feel more empowered and connected to the entity when they have a direct say and voting power on all matters. These individuals may not have strong voting power, but a DAO encourages token holders to cast votes, burn tokens, or use their tokens in ways they think is best for the entity.

### Publicity
Within a DAO, votes are cast via blockchain and made publicly viewable. This requires users to act in ways they feel is best, as their vote and their decisions will be made publicly viewable. This incentivizes actions that will benefit voters' reputations and discourage acts against the community.

### Community
The concept of a DAO encourages people from all over the world to seamlessly come together to build a single vision. With just an internet connection, token holders can interact with other owners wherever they may live.


## Transition to the community

During the transition to the community a number of basic governance structures must be established which will be the foundation of the DAO. These include:

- Assigning 5 authors to the SnapShot.org BlocksWorkz.xyz space so that proposals can be voted on. The wallets that hold the most BLKZ will have the option of becoming an author, if the wallet owner decides not to become an author the option will move to the next wallet in decending order.
- Publishing the XDCNFT and XDCSwaps source code to public repo. Terms of use will include that ANY projects cloning or using this source code must allow the BLKZ token as a medium of exchange OR pay the BLKZ treasury account a licence fee of 10,000,000 BLKZ
- Transition the domain ownership and records to the community control
- Transition the hosting to community control
