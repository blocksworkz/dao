# How to contribute

Contributing to the governance of the project can be completed by being a BLKZ token owner only. The DAO is configured to allow those who have BLKZ in their wallet to take control of decisions.

## Connecting Wallet
At the time of writing MetaMask is recommended as the wallet of choice when contributing, other wallets are supported by SnapShot.org however these are not all compatible with the XDC Network including XDC Pay wallet.

The network settings recommended for use are below: 

 - Network Name - XDC Mainnet (RPC)
 - RPC - https://rpc.xinfin.network
 - Chain ID - 50
 - Currency Symbol - XDC
 - Block Explorer - https://explorer.xinfin.network/

## Adding BLKZ to MetaMask
The BLKZ token will need to be added to MetaMask so that when you connect to the space on SnapShot.org the balance can be checked. The steps are below:

 1. Open MetaMask
 2. Your balance will be displayed
 3. Click the Import Tokens link
 4. In the token address enter - 0x4826634fe187ed3ffb64d77c5c1a67ba49cc03de
 5. The token symbol will automatically display BLKZ and the decimals will be set to 18
 6. You will now see the BLKZ token amount under the Assets

## How do I create a proposal?
You must be an Author to create a proposal so if you are not an assigned Author please contact one in order to put your proposal forward.

When an Author connects to BlocksWorkz.xyz space on SnapShot.org, they can create a proposal using the below URL:

https://snapshot.org/#/blocksworkz.xyz/create/-1

A proposal must contain:

### Step 1
 - **Proposal Title** - Title of the proposal
 - **Description** - Description of request including any images and content
 - **Discussion** - Link to the Telegram group
### Step 2
 - **Voting** - Decide on the voting type such as Basic e.g. For, Against, Abstain
 -  - **Voting Period** - Decide on the voting duration

Once the proposal has been created the community can then vote on the outcome. The settings of the space ensure that the BLKZ tokens held in the wallet are recorded which can determine the weighting of the vote.

## How can the community vote on this?
Anyone with the BLKZ token in their wallet can vote, no matter how many tokens they hold. The more tokens held the more weighting is assigned to the vote.

When a proposal is created it is up to the community to communicate and circulate for consideration, this is the basis of a DAO.


## How can I join and discuss proposals?
At the time of writing you can join the Telegram group and share/discuss ideas on new, existing or previous proposals.
